				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In India, every beginning is marked by gold, whether it be birth or a beginning of matrimonial life. The child is welcomed by the family members by showering the child with gold and in every stage of life such as graduating college to landing the first job. The importance of gold only increases as time goes on, the beginnings are also marked with gold such as engagement rings and gold coins. </p>
<p>Gifting gold is a sign of emotional attachment, as the sentiment of the gift is made stronger with economic stability. Every jewellery tells a story, we would love to tell your story with your designs and our craftsmanship. Even a simple idea of using one’s name instead of gems can make a very personal statement. The designer jewellery can be a combination of one’s signature and creativity. Experimenting and combining with different designs can bring unexpected and surprising designs. In a country like India where there is a diverse array of cultures and languages, fusing different designs from different parts of the country can be a design and style in itself.</p>
<p>Bring your ideas and creativity to us at Nakshatra gold and diamonds to help us to bring your ideas and creativity to life.</p>
