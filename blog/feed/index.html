				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Citrine and Topaz are the birthstones of November. These are the beautiful golden, lemon-coloured gems that will give you the golden summery feeling in this approaching winter. November is a month of weddings and celebrations and hence some lightweight gemstone studded jewels will be a perfect gift. Here is a little about the history of these mind-blowing natural beauties, Citrine and Topaz.</p>
<p><strong>Citrine</strong><br />
The bright shining gem has said to be a gift from the sun and it’s believed to be a healing gemstone. The name Citrine, which is French for lemon, fits well with its colour range of juicy lemon yellow to a bright orangey brown. This birthstone is named after the citrus fruit due to its yellow-orange colour. Its yellow colour is caused by specks of iron found in the quartz crystal. Most people choose Citrine based on their personal preference, but some of the most sought-after Citrine gemstones have a clear, radiant yellowish to brownish red colour.<br />
Citrine is said to reduce anger and create calmness in the mind.  It is a self-healing stone, cleansing the body of any negative attributes. It harnesses the power of the sun, bringing happiness to one’s life.<br />
Citrine is one of the most powerful and affordable gemstones. It is relatively plentiful and available in a wide range of sizes and shapes including very large sizes. These reasons make it a great gem for that big, bold, statement piece.</p>
<p><strong>Topaz</strong><br />
The name Topaz has been thought to originate from the Sanskrit word meaning “Tapaz” or “Life”. Topaz is commonly yellow and easily confused for citrine. Topaz is available in many colours and variations such as imperial topaz (the most prized) or blue topaz (very rare). The ancient Egyptians and Romans associated this golden gem with the sun god giving it the power to protect and heal. Legend says that topaz dispels enchantment. This gem has carved itself its own niche in the market, because of the gems superior hardness and beautiful colour range it&#8217;s a gem that’s hard to replicate. Generally seen as long faceted stones, it complements its natural crystal formation. Topaz represents love and affection. It is said to be the bringer of abundance, granting the wearer a happy and fulfilled life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Diwali is the biggest and the most-awaited of all the festivals in India. It’s not just a festival of lights but also a festival of carefree indulgence. The mood of the nation turns festive and this lucrative market is captured by every brands with wide array of discounts, offers, new launches, etc. Everyone is on a spending spree to gift their loved ones and indulge in various pleasures like sweets, shopping, socialising, gifting, and most of all – buying gold.<br />
Although, unlike other states in South India, God’s own country as Kerala is famously own do not celebrate Diwali festival traditionally. Nevertheless, the day is considered auspicious in Kerala as it is across the country, and with advent of people from other states to Kerala, celebrating the festival has been quite well adapted. </p>
<p><strong>Tradition and Gold</strong><br />
Buying gold is like a ritual in almost every Indian festival or occasions like weddings. The tradition of buying gold during Diwali has continued for over thousands of years in India and the practise doesn’t seem to fade away in Kerala. Gold is not merely a precious metal in India, or an investment option, but it holds great sentimental value for people here. Jewellery is an integral part of Diwali, and lifts above any other purchases. This yellow metal is considered auspicious and an integral part of the tradition. There is an emotional connect with buying Gold during Diwali. </p>
<p><strong>When it all began</strong><br />
The first day of the five day Diwali celebrations is considered the most auspicious for buying Gold, silver or any kind of wealth like property, new vehicle, etc. This day is called Dhanteras, ‘Dhan’ meaning wealth, and ‘teras’ meaning 13th day as per the Hindu calendar.</p>
<p>According to a proverb, the story of Dhanteras revolves around a 16-year old King and his newly-wed wife. A prophecy had indicated the king will die on the fourth-day of marriage. In order to keep her husband awake and safe, his newly wedded wife is believed to have made a heap of her ornaments, including lots of gold and silver coins at the entrance of the sleeping chamber. She is then believed to have sung songs and narrated stories. The next day, when the God of Death, Yama came to take the king, his eyes were dazzled by the blinding gold and silver. Unable to enter the chamber, Yama climbed the heap of wealth and sat there listening to the songs and stories. Later, Yama is believed to have left silently without taking the king.<br />
From that time onwards, buying gold or silver or even other forms of ‘dhan’ or wealth has been considered auspicious to keep evil and death away.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People born in the month of October are very lucky to have two gorgeous birthstones to choose from – opal and tourmaline. As legend holds, the birthstones of October birthstones came to earth through a journey involving rainbows. Therefore each gem is supposed to unveil limitless possibilities as each one comes in a rainbow of shades and colour combinations.<br />
The main quality of tourmaline stone is that the colours we see are produced due to the presence of trace elements in its chemical makeup, whereas the Opal stone shows a play of multiple colours due to light diffraction. Hence, October’s birthstones offer a full spectrum of gems to suit anyone’s personal tastes.</p>
<p><strong>TOURMALINE</strong><br />
<img src="http://nakshatragoldanddiamonds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/tourmaline-300x188.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="188" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-104" srcset="http://nakshatragoldanddiamonds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/tourmaline-300x188.jpg 300w, http://nakshatragoldanddiamonds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/tourmaline-768x480.jpg 768w, http://nakshatragoldanddiamonds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/tourmaline-1024x640.jpg 1024w, http://nakshatragoldanddiamonds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/tourmaline.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><br />
The name of this gemstone is believed to have derived from a Sri Lanka word “toramalli,” a term used to describe yellow, green or brownstones, meaning “something little out of the earth.” This beautiful stone of Tourmaline is usually the favourite gemstone for many because of its rainbow shade of colours. Most tourmalines are found in a myriad of colours with some even having bi-coloured properties. A valued bi-coloured variety of tourmaline is found in Brazil which is called the “watermelon.” The outer edges of this gem are green, transitioning to a transparent white zone that gives way to a pink or light red interior.<br />
Unlike other gemstones, tourmalines are a relatively recent discovery. This incredible stone is believed to have some super powers, it gives you strength to ward off evil energy, as well as has the power to inspire creativity. Next time you’re facing writer’s block or need an idea, try wearing some tourmaline jewellery!</p>
<p><strong>OPAL</strong><br />
<img src="http://nakshatragoldanddiamonds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Black-Opal-Australia-300x144.png" alt="" width="300" height="144" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-105" srcset="http://nakshatragoldanddiamonds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Black-Opal-Australia-300x144.png 300w, http://nakshatragoldanddiamonds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Black-Opal-Australia-768x369.png 768w, http://nakshatragoldanddiamonds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Black-Opal-Australia-1024x492.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><br />
The name Opal is derived from the Sanskrit word “upala,” as well as the Latin “opalus,” meaning “precious stone.” Opal is said to have been made up of the glories of the most precious stones in this world, thus is also known as the Queen of gems. They are popularly known for their milky, rainbow-coloured flow and each stone is as unique as our fingerprints.<br />
The principal source of opals is Australia, which is also noted for its magnificent black opals. An ideal Opal is said to have broad patterns covering the surface with all the colours of the rainbow. Opal gemstone is considered to be symbols of hope and purity and is associated with luck.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The birthstone of September</p>
<p>The word sapphire has its roots in several languages, in the Arabic safir, the Latin sapphirus (meaning blue), and the Greek word sappheiros for the island of Sapphirine in the Arabian Sea where sapphires were found in ancient Grecian times. It was the gem of Apollo, Greek God of prophecy and was worn by worshipers visiting his shrine in Delphi to seek his help. It was used by ancient Etruscans as far back as the 7th century B.C. The best-known sapphires are the rich blue variety, but they actually come in every colour of the rainbow—including pink, yellow, orange, and green. Because of its hardness, sapphire also has industrial uses. The Apple Watch features lab-created sapphire glass on its screen.</p>
<p> In a spiritual context, the stone sapphire is said to hold wisdom, power, and faith. You would wear sapphire to protect your from envy and help bring blessings from heaven down upon you. It was said that if you put a venomous reptile or a spider in a jar with the stone that the creature would die thus some also used the stone to protect them from snakes and spiders. Priests from the middle ages often worn this stone to help protect them from temptations of the flesh, and impure thoughts. The sapphire was also popular with royalty as they wanted protection from envy and harm. Warriors even valued this stone as they would give sapphire necklaces to their wives before they go into battle to prevent unfaithfulness. They believe the stone’s colour would darken if a woman was unfaithful.</p>
<p>This September birthstone has been believed to protect the wearer from envy and harm and attracts blessings from heaven. Sapphire, with its stunning blue shades, is a symbol heaven and considered to indicate the purity of the soul. This gem signifies truth, faithfulness and sincerity, and was worn by priests during the Middle Ages as a talisman against impure thoughts and temptation. Sapphire is thought to boost intuition and clairvoyance and promote good health. Incorporated in royal ornaments, it symbolized a pure and wise reign. This gem gives a sense of inner peace and develops a positive attitude in the wearer.</p>

<p>Gold was considered a universal currency for hundreds of years. Due to its recognized value worldwide, a gold standard was used as far back as the Byzantine Empire over 1,500 years ago. Until 1944, in fact, gold was used as the world reserve currency. But when it comes to India, gold is a solid investment cause gold does not carry much risk, as we hardly see deflation in the real sense. Even when the official figures, were showing negative inflation (deflation) during the last year, the actual prices of food items were increasing. This was reflected in the gold prices too. Gold is a solid investment even in terms of liquidity, compared to all other investments. At any time of the day and any day gold can literally be converted to cash. Banks would give you a jewellery loan and so would your friendly neighbourhood pawn shop. The global gold value remains unaffected by local political chaos. The demand of gold may go up or down but it never ends. Gold is a good way to diversify an investor’s portfolio because it moves inversely to stock and currency value. High liquidity and universality of gold make it a favoured choice for investors across the globe. It can be cashed easily and it is accepted as a mode of payment and security worldwide. There’s a finite supply of gold in the world, which creates exponential price rises when demand increases. Production cannot simply rise to meet an increased demand, so the supply/demand dynamic naturally drives prices higher. This also reduces the risk of devaluation, as lower prices then quickly attract more, new demand, which will once again fuel price increases. In its physical form, the holder has no risk to any counterparty. This is particularly relevant in today’s new financial world, where money is no longer even safe in a bank account. It also avoids the counterparty exposure that exists with investments in gold stocks, futures and options In fact, many gold investors and collectors take great pride in their coin portfolios, often preserving them within their families for several generations. This habit also contributes to a limited market supply, once again affecting gold’s value!</p>
