				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Citrine and Topaz are the birthstones of November. These are the beautiful golden, lemon-coloured gems that will give you the golden summery feeling in this approaching winter. November is a month of weddings and celebrations and hence some lightweight gemstone studded jewels will be a perfect gift. Here is a little about the history of these mind-blowing natural beauties, Citrine and Topaz.</p>
<p><strong>Citrine</strong><br />
The bright shining gem has said to be a gift from the sun and it’s believed to be a healing gemstone. The name Citrine, which is French for lemon, fits well with its colour range of juicy lemon yellow to a bright orangey brown. This birthstone is named after the citrus fruit due to its yellow-orange colour. Its yellow colour is caused by specks of iron found in the quartz crystal. Most people choose Citrine based on their personal preference, but some of the most sought-after Citrine gemstones have a clear, radiant yellowish to brownish red colour.<br />
Citrine is said to reduce anger and create calmness in the mind.  It is a self-healing stone, cleansing the body of any negative attributes. It harnesses the power of the sun, bringing happiness to one’s life.<br />
Citrine is one of the most powerful and affordable gemstones. It is relatively plentiful and available in a wide range of sizes and shapes including very large sizes. These reasons make it a great gem for that big, bold, statement piece.</p>
<p><strong>Topaz</strong><br />
The name Topaz has been thought to originate from the Sanskrit word meaning “Tapaz” or “Life”. Topaz is commonly yellow and easily confused for citrine. Topaz is available in many colours and variations such as imperial topaz (the most prized) or blue topaz (very rare). The ancient Egyptians and Romans associated this golden gem with the sun god giving it the power to protect and heal. Legend says that topaz dispels enchantment. This gem has carved itself its own niche in the market, because of the gems superior hardness and beautiful colour range it&#8217;s a gem that’s hard to replicate. Generally seen as long faceted stones, it complements its natural crystal formation. Topaz represents love and affection. It is said to be the bringer of abundance, granting the wearer a happy and fulfilled life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People born in the month of October are very lucky to have two gorgeous birthstones to choose from – opal and tourmaline. As legend holds, the birthstones of October birthstones came to earth through a journey involving rainbows. Therefore each gem is supposed to unveil limitless possibilities as each one comes in a rainbow of shades and colour combinations.<br />
The main quality of tourmaline stone is that the colours we see are produced due to the presence of trace elements in its chemical makeup, whereas the Opal stone shows a play of multiple colours due to light diffraction. Hence, October’s birthstones offer a full spectrum of gems to suit anyone’s personal tastes.</p>
<p><strong>TOURMALINE</strong><br />
<img src="http://nakshatragoldanddiamonds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/tourmaline-300x188.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="188" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-104" srcset="http://nakshatragoldanddiamonds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/tourmaline-300x188.jpg 300w, http://nakshatragoldanddiamonds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/tourmaline-768x480.jpg 768w, http://nakshatragoldanddiamonds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/tourmaline-1024x640.jpg 1024w, http://nakshatragoldanddiamonds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/tourmaline.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><br />
The name of this gemstone is believed to have derived from a Sri Lanka word “toramalli,” a term used to describe yellow, green or brownstones, meaning “something little out of the earth.” This beautiful stone of Tourmaline is usually the favourite gemstone for many because of its rainbow shade of colours. Most tourmalines are found in a myriad of colours with some even having bi-coloured properties. A valued bi-coloured variety of tourmaline is found in Brazil which is called the “watermelon.” The outer edges of this gem are green, transitioning to a transparent white zone that gives way to a pink or light red interior.<br />
Unlike other gemstones, tourmalines are a relatively recent discovery. This incredible stone is believed to have some super powers, it gives you strength to ward off evil energy, as well as has the power to inspire creativity. Next time you’re facing writer’s block or need an idea, try wearing some tourmaline jewellery!</p>
<p><strong>OPAL</strong><br />

The name Opal is derived from the Sanskrit word “upala,” as well as the Latin “opalus,” meaning “precious stone.” Opal is said to have been made up of the glories of the most precious stones in this world, thus is also known as the Queen of gems. They are popularly known for their milky, rainbow-coloured flow and each stone is as unique as our fingerprints.<br />
The principal source of opals is Australia, which is also noted for its magnificent black opals. An ideal Opal is said to have broad patterns covering the surface with all the colours of the rainbow. Opal gemstone is considered to be symbols of hope and purity and is associated with luck.</p>
