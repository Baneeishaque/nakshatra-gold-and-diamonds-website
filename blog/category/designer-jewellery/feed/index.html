				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The birthstone of September</p>
<p>The word sapphire has its roots in several languages, in the Arabic safir, the Latin sapphirus (meaning blue), and the Greek word sappheiros for the island of Sapphirine in the Arabian Sea where sapphires were found in ancient Grecian times. It was the gem of Apollo, Greek God of prophecy and was worn by worshipers visiting his shrine in Delphi to seek his help. It was used by ancient Etruscans as far back as the 7th century B.C. The best-known sapphires are the rich blue variety, but they actually come in every colour of the rainbow—including pink, yellow, orange, and green. Because of its hardness, sapphire also has industrial uses. The Apple Watch features lab-created sapphire glass on its screen.</p>
<p> In a spiritual context, the stone sapphire is said to hold wisdom, power, and faith. You would wear sapphire to protect your from envy and help bring blessings from heaven down upon you. It was said that if you put a venomous reptile or a spider in a jar with the stone that the creature would die thus some also used the stone to protect them from snakes and spiders. Priests from the middle ages often worn this stone to help protect them from temptations of the flesh, and impure thoughts. The sapphire was also popular with royalty as they wanted protection from envy and harm. Warriors even valued this stone as they would give sapphire necklaces to their wives before they go into battle to prevent unfaithfulness. They believe the stone’s colour would darken if a woman was unfaithful.</p>
<p>This September birthstone has been believed to protect the wearer from envy and harm and attracts blessings from heaven. Sapphire, with its stunning blue shades, is a symbol heaven and considered to indicate the purity of the soul. This gem signifies truth, faithfulness and sincerity, and was worn by priests during the Middle Ages as a talisman against impure thoughts and temptation. Sapphire is thought to boost intuition and clairvoyance and promote good health. Incorporated in royal ornaments, it symbolized a pure and wise reign. This gem gives a sense of inner peace and develops a positive attitude in the wearer.</p>
